# Study Buddy

### This is a webapp to help students streamline the process of organizing study meetups.

* Fill out the form with name, location, and how long user would like to study for
* On form submission, user will see a map of their fellow students and current location, as well as a list of fellow students to choose to meetup with
* Upon choosing a classmate to meet with, a new map will populate with study spots between the two of users

This was the first group project assigned during the Coding BootCamp class in December 2018 and was originally named "SAKI study" based on our first name initials.
* Suzanne Hunter (Front-end: Bootstrap, CSS, Colors)
* Alex Kluger (Back-end: Form validation and Yelp API AJAX calls)
* Kevin Bray (Front and Back-end: Moment and presentation powerpoint)
* Ize Imai (Back-end: TomTom SDK, Leaflet.js, Math for distance calculation, Firebase clearing and pushing to local storage)

In this forked version, I plan to use Node.js to hide my API keys rather than post them in GitHub. I would like to also make the student selection page/map more intuitive by making the icon clicks link to radio buttons or better yet, remove the table entirely so the selection can be made within the map.
